                        <p>"Christ is my cheerleader and closest friend who always understands my heart and will forgive all that I’ve done. I feel like when I surround more of my life with him, I am a better version of myself. He helps me become and evolve into the child of God I hope to be."</p>
                        <p>"Christ is my anchor in stormy weather and my safe haven thru all life’s challenges. I am so grateful for my testimony that Christ can heal whatever is broken, including my self esteem. I know without a doubt that I am securely attached when I am focused on Christ."</p>
                        <p>"I feel grateful to have Christ as our perfect example. Sometimes when I'm struggling with a hard decision or a bad thought, I remember to ask myself "what would Christ do". I feel the immense love he has for me and everyone of us as our elder brother."</p>
                        <p>"Jesus Christ is my personal Savior and Redeemer. He is the Way, the Truth and the Life. The greatest gifts of mortality and eternity are possible only because of Him. The document “The Living Christ” summarizes my feelings."</p>
                        <p>"Most unfairly treated being, yet by obedience was perfect to perform his Fathers will to redeem us and did it. His greatest desire is for us to know him and our Father as the Father and Son know each other."</p>
                        <p>"Christ is my constant source of strength, encouragement and peace. I feel overwhelmed with gratitude for all He has done for me. I trust in Him completely which amplifies my gratitude."</p>
                        <p>"Christ is my greatest friend, my comforter, and my Savior. I know that he understands me best, and can then comfort me best. I’ve become so much more as I have him in my life."</p>
                        <p>"Christ is my friend and teacher. Sometimes I don't understand him, or get mad when I don't understand something, but I love him and am grateful for him."</p>
                        <p>"I feel indebted for Christ’s sacrifice for me. Judicially I don’t deserve to be saved but because of his love for me and his sacrifice, I can be."</p>
                        <p>"I love my Savior, I know that He has saved me and everyone else from a fallen state. I feel a deep sense of gratitude towards Him for that."</p>
