                        <p>This Semester I have learned so much more about my Savior Jesus Christ. While serving on my mission I read Jesus the Christ by James E. Talmage and I learned so much about Him. I had never felt closer to Jesus. However, recently I feel like while I have been studying the gospel, I have not been studying Christ. This semester has been great for reemphasizing the importance of studying and spending time with Christ. While reading through the scriptures for this class I have been searching through the Book of Mormon on the side to find the teachings of the gospel of Jesus Christ found in the Book of Mormon. I have included those findings on another page. I hope you enjoy reading the scriptures and the testimonies of Christ!</p>
                        <p>While studying the stories of Jesus Christ this semester the faith and imperfections of the apostles stood out to me the most. It may have been because I was watching The Chosen this summer, but I really liked learning about the apostles and what they emphasized in their writings. I felt like it was their personal testimony of Christ. They wrote about how they came to know that Jesus was the Christ. Before this class, I didn't know that certain themes were in each of the books of the bible. While I had read the bible many times I had never taken apart a story and read it from the different accounts to find the differences. Doing this opened my eyes to the lives of the apostles and their love for Christ. While they were not perfect they loved the Savior and tried their best to do His will. I find myself relating the most with Luke. In his book, Luke focuses on the poor and the sinners. He focuses on how Jesus cares about all of His children. These stories are how I came to know Christ. The stories from Luke teach me that I have a second chance and that I can change. They teach me that Christ has all power and can change both the physical body and spiritual nature of people. I am grateful for the writings of Luke and I am grateful for my Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
